# mc-tipped-arrows

This is a PaperMC plugin that adds less-expensive recipes for creating tipped arrows.

## Why?
It's way more expensive to create tipped arrows in Minecraft Java Edition than it is in Bedrock Edition.

In Bedrock you simply add potions to a cauldron & dip your arrows in it.

While in Java, you have to fight the Ender Dragon to obtain Dragon's Breath, & then use that to create lingering potions, & finally tipped arrows.

This plugin allows you to simply add a potion to a crafting table, with 8 arrows around it to create 8 tipped arrows.

This plugin is also useful for servers running GeyserMC, where Bedrock tipped arrow functionality is disabled.
