# mc-tipped-arrows

This is a PaperMC plugin that adds less-expensive recipes for creating tipped arrows.

# Why?
It's way more expensive to create tipped arrows in Minecraft Java Edition than it is in Bedrock Edition. In Bedrock you simply add potions to a cauldron & dip your arrows in it. While in Java, you have to fight the Ender Dragon to obtain Dragon's Breath, & then use that to create lingering potions, & finally tipped arrows.

This plugin allows you to simply add 3 of the same potions to a crafting table, along with a stack of arrows to create a stack of tipped arrows. This makes it match the same expense as Bedrock Edition.

This plugin is also useful for servers running GeyserMC, where Bedrock tipped arrow functionality is disabled.
